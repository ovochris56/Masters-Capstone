#  🩺 Master's Capstone: Bridging Language Barriers in Rhode Island EHR Systems

## 📊 Project Overview
This capstone project explores health inequities across Rhode Island counties by analyzing patient demographics, language data, and prescription refill trends to identify barriers to EHR comprehension and patient engagement.  
It integrates **data storytelling, health equity, and visual analytics** to propose bilingual, plain-language redesigns for patient portals that improve accessibility for Spanish and Portuguese-speaking populations in Providence County.

Tools Used: Tableau, Excel

📊 Project Overview

This project examines disparities in electronic health record (EHR) comprehension among Rhode Island residents, with a particular focus on Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking populations in Providence County. The goal was to identify key barriers that limit patient understanding, engagement, and health outcomes, then design an equity-centered redesign for patient portals that integrates translation layers and plain-language dashboards.

This capstone was completed as part of my Master of Health Informatics program and serves as a data storytelling project combining health equity, informatics design, and visual analytics.

🎯 Purpose & Objectives

Purpose

To address inequities in patient understanding of EHR information by proposing patient-centered redesigns that simplify medical language and make health data more accessible across linguistic and cultural boundaries.

Objectives
	1.	Identify Barriers: Analyze demographic, language, and socioeconomic data to locate counties with the highest risk of misunderstanding EHR information.
	2.	Redesign Workflows: Simplify patient journeys by translating medical jargon into bilingual, plain-language explanations.
	3.	Develop Equity-Driven Dashboards: Build Tableau visualizations demonstrating language accessibility and health equity patterns.
	4.	Plan Budgets & Timelines: Define realistic cost estimates and phased implementation strategies.
	5.	Train & Evaluate: Propose training frameworks for providers and IT staff with measurable outcomes like improved usability and comprehension.

🧩 Data Insights
	•	Providence County has the largest population in Rhode Island (660K+) but the lowest civic engagement and EHR comprehension rates.
	•	6.1% of residents are not English proficient — the highest in the state, correlating with lower health portal usage and digital literacy.
	•	Latino populations and single-parent households showed the strongest link between language barriers and care gaps.
	•	Translation & visualization improvements in patient portals can directly enhance comprehension, reduce provider clarifications, and improve outcomes.

📈 Visual Dashboards

All dashboards were created in Tableau Public to highlight Rhode Island’s population, literacy, and language trends by county.

Key Visuals:
	•	County Participation Chart: Displays civic engagement and census response rates by county.
	•	Demographic Breakdown: Highlights Latino population, non-English speakers, and household structures.
	•	Language Accessibility Bubble Chart: Visualizes limited English proficiency vs. population size.

🧠 Tools & Technologies
	•	Tableau Public: Data visualization and storytelling
	•	Excel: Data cleaning and preprocessing
	•	Power BI (optional): Comparative prototype dashboards
	•	Public Data Sources: U.S. Census Bureau, Rhode Island Department of Health

💡 Key Takeaways
	•	Language accessibility isn’t just a communication issue, it’s a data equity issue.
	•	Visual analytics can bridge the gap between policy, patient understanding, and system design.
	•	Health informatics leaders must integrate equity, usability, and empathy in every dashboard and workflow.

🏁 Outcome

This project laid the foundation for a bilingual, patient-friendly EHR system designed for equity, comprehension, and long-term engagement.

“Health data is only powerful if people can understand it.”
